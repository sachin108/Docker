Installation and setup
    Because of the complexity of Kubernetes, Docker Swarm is easier to install and configure.

Scalability
    Kubernetes offers all-in-one scaling based on traffic, while Docker Swarm emphasizes scaling quickly.

    Kubernetes: Horizontal autoscaling is built in.
    Swarm: Offers autoscaling of groups on demand.

Load balancing
    Docker Swarm has automatic load balancing, while Kubernetes does not. However, an external load balancer can easily be integrated via third-party tools in Kubernetes.

High availability
    Both tools provide a high level of availability.

    Kubernetes: By diverting traffic away from unhealthy pods, Kubernetes is self-healing. It offers intelligent scheduling and high availability of services through replication.
    
    Swarm: Swarm Managers offer availability controls, and microservices can be easily duplicated.
