Environment variables are dynamic values that can be accessed and modified 
by processes running in an operating system. 
They are used to store configuration settings, system paths, and other information 
that applications  need to function correctly. 

In the context of Docker, environment variables play a crucial role in configuring 
containers and defining runtime parameters for applications within the container. 

Docker provides various ways to set and use environment variables:

    Setting Environment Variables in Dockerfile:
        In a Dockerfile, you can use the ENV instruction to set environment 
        variables. This makes them available to the application running inside 
        the container.

        Example:

        Dockerfile
            # Set environment variable
            ENV MY_VARIABLE=my_value

            # Use the environment variable in the command
            CMD echo "Value of MY_VARIABLE is $MY_VARIABLE"

        Setting Environment Variables during Container Run:
            When running a Docker container, you can use the -e or --env 
            flag to set environment variables.

            Example:

                docker run -e MY_VARIABLE=my_value my_image
    
        Using Environment Variables in Compose Files:
            In Docker Compose files, you can define environment variables for 
            services using the environment or env_file keys.

    Example (using environment):

        version: "3"
        services:
        my_service:
            image: my_image
            environment:
            MY_VARIABLE: my_value

    Example (using env_file):

    version: "3"
    services:
    my_service:
        image: my_image
        env_file:
        - ./my_env_file.env

    Default Values and Shell Expansions:
        Docker allows you to specify default values for environment 
        variables and perform shell expansions within the variable 
        definition.

        Example:

        Dockerfile

        # Set a default value for the environment variable
        ENV MY_VARIABLE=my_default_value

        # Use shell expansion to set the environment variable
        ENV MY_PATH=/my/app
        ENV PATH=$PATH:$MY_PATH

    Environment variables are essential for configuring containerized 
    applications, specifying credentials, providing runtime settings, 
    and making containers adaptable to different environments. 
    They are widely used in containerized environments to promote 
    portability and ease of configuration management.
