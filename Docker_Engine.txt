What is Docker Engine?
    Docker Engine is the underlying client-server technology that supports 
    the tasks and workflows involved in building, shipping and running 
    containerized applications using Docker's components and services.

    Used alone, the term Docker can refer either to Docker Engine or to the 
    company Docker Inc., which offers various editions of containerization 
    technology around Docker Engine.

Components of Docker Engine
    Docker Engine is an open source technology comprising a server with a 
    daemon process called dockerd, a REST API and a client-side command-line 
    interface (CLI) called docker. 
    The engine creates a server-side daemon process that hosts images, 
    containers, networks and storage volumes. The CLI lets users interact 
    with the Docker daemon via the API.

Docker Engine and swarm mode
    A swarm is a cluster of connected Docker Engines onto which admins 
    can deploy application services. In version 1.12, Docker incorporated 
    Docker Swarm directly into Docker Engine and renamed the orchestration 
    service swarm mode. Swarm mode is Docker Engine's native clustering 
    and orchestration service, although Docker Engine can run other 
    options, such as Kubernetes.
