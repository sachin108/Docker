This command in docker starts the docker container with container id 
    docker start container_name_or_id

Stop a container with container id
    docker kill container_name_or_id

    docker kill is a forceful termination, immediately stopping the 
    container without giving the application inside it a chance to clean up. 
    On the other hand, docker stop is a more controlled and graceful way to 
    stop a container, allowing the application to perform necessary cleanup
    tasks before shutting down. It is generally recommended to use docker 
    stop whenever possible, as it helps ensure data integrity and allows 
    applications to shut down cleanly. However, in some cases, such as when 
    a container is unresponsive or misbehaving, docker kill may be necessary 
    to forcefully terminate the container.
