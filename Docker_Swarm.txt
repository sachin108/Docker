In enterprise applications, the number of containers can quickly grow to an 
unmanageable number. To use your containers most effectively, you’ll need to 
orchestrate your containerized applications, which is where Kubernetes and 
Docker Swarm come in.

Docker Swarm is open-source container orchestration platform that has been 
around for a while. Swarm — or more accurately, swarm mode — is Docker’s 
native support for orchestrating clusters of Docker engines. 
A Swarm cluster consists of Docker Engine-deployed Swarm manager nodes 
(which orchestrate and manage the cluster) and worker nodes (which are 
directed to execute tasks by the manager nodes).

It smoothly integrates with Docker tools like Docker Compose and Docker 
CLI since it uses the same command line interface (CLI) as Docker Engine.
    
It uses a filtering and scheduling system to provide intelligent node 
selection, allowing you to pick the optimal nodes in a cluster for container 
deployment.

In swarm mode, Docker hosts are called nodes. Each swarm-controlled cluster 
includes one or more swarm manager nodes and worker nodes on which the 
swarm component acts as an agent.

Swarms usually include multiple swarm managers to enhance availability. 
Manager tasks include cluster functions such as placement, scaling, and 
recovery actions for the workloads.
